# PhysicsSims
A series of physics simulations, largely electromagnetic field models, written in python. Some made for my PHY-4B class, most for fun. 
Uses the vPython library, which I had difficulty setting up. However, any scripts can be run using https://glowscript.org

# Electric Field Lines
## Arrows
6 arrows surrounding one charged particle, pointing in the direction of the electric field of the particle.
## Arrows More Points
22 arrows surrounding two charged particles, pointing int the direction of the electric field of the dipole
## Lines
24 observation particles move from the positive particle towards the negative particle, tracing the electric field lines
## Lines 2 Positives
24 observation particles move from 2 postive particles on opposite sides of a negative particle, tracing the electric field lines
## Lines Rod
Observation particles trace the electric field lines of a series of alternating charged particles
## Lines Rod Clean
Observation particles trace the electric field lines of a a charged rod, with one half positive and one half negative
